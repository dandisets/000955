description: 'In these recordings, we stimulate rats that were injected with AAV virus
  to optogenetically tag for CamKII  to distinguish between excitatory pyramidal neurons
  and inhibitory interneurons. We alternate between stimulating them optogenetically
  in order to tag the neuronal subtype and testing different PRFs (pulse repetition
  frequencies) and pulse durations of ultrasound stimulation using a 128-element random
  array ultrasound transducer to stimulate the somatosensory cortex. Electrophysiological
  recordings were acquired using 32-channel NeuroNexus electrodes (Model: A1x32-Poly3-10mm-50-177-A32),
  surgically inserted into the rat brain. Ultrasound stimulation is delivered every
  2.5 seconds with a 10% jitter, and each recording has 500 trials. The PRFs tested
  were 30 Hz, 300 Hz, 1500 Hz, 3000 Hz, and 4500 Hz, with pulse durations including
  4, 40, 200, and 400 microseconds, and a 67 ms ultrasound duration.


  File Information All 10 subjects were male rats, implanted with their chronic electrode
  at 6 months of age and then recordings taken first at 8-10 months, and then some
  repeats taken at 12 months. Within each subject''s folder are recordings for the
  different PRFs. Most subjects have 5 recordings within, one for each PRF. Some subjects
  have duplicate recordings taken a few months after the original ones. A few recordings
  were not included due to excessive noise in the recordings. Files are named in the
  format SubjectName_PRF_PulseDuration. Each file contains spike time data with the
  cell type labels included for each neurons, as well as time series data for the
  onset of each trial of ultrasound stimulation.'
